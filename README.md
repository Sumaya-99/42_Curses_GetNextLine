#42_Curses_GetNextLine

Project Overview: 42_Curses_GetNextLine

The project objective entailed the development of a function capable of reading from either a text file or stdin.

Parsing the input line by line with each function call, delineated by the newline character (\n). 

As a bonus challenge, the task extended to enabling the function to read from multiple files while retaining the parsing state to resume reading from where it last stopped in preceding files.
